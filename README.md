Features
Display current weather conditions by searching city name.
Automatic location detection or manual location input for accurate weather information.

API Integration
The app integrates with a weather API to fetch weather data. I am using openweather for generating the API key. You can obtain an API key by signing up on the weather service's website.

Dependencies
provider - State management for toggling the theme.
http - For making HTTP requests to the weather API.
For a complete list of dependencies, check the pubspec.yaml file.
